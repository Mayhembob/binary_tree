binary_tree
===========
This code is me working through binary tree problems from http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/BinaryTrees.html#s2
Most of the solutions I came up with are similar to the answers given on that site. 
The printTree() method I have found very useful for checking the structure of the tree, 
since it prints the children for each node.
